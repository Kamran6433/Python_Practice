# This method returns a string with the first character being capitalized.

casefold = "CASEFOLD"

print("Text: " + text)

# This method returns a string with all characters lower case.

# This method returns a string which is filled with the number of spaces specified with the string in the middle of
# the space. The second argument is what should be filled in for the space. Default is " ".

# This method returns the number of times a specified value appears in the string.
# The second argument is the position to start the search and the third argument is the position to end the search.

# Parameter	            Description
# encoding	            Optional. A String specifying the encoding to use. Default is UTF-8
# errors	            Optional. A String specifying the error method. Legal values are:
# 'backslashreplace'	- uses a backslash instead of the character that could not be encoded
# 'ignore'	            - ignores the characters that cannot be encoded
# 'namereplace'	        - replaces the character with a text explaining the character
# 'strict'	            - Default, raises an error on failure
# 'replace'	            - replaces the character with a questionmark
# 'xmlcharrefreplace'	- replaces the character with an xml character
e = text.encode(encoding="ascii", errors="namereplace")
