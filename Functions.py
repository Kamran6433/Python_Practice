# Functions are really important in programming because it cuts down large chunks of code into smaller chunks.
# Functions are able to pass data through them and manipulate data through parameters.
# Functions need to be called to be executed otherwise they will be redundant.
def sum(x, y):
    return x + y


# Functions in Python need two lines of space after the last line because Python doesn't have curly braces to
# structure code. Instead, Python uses indentation.
